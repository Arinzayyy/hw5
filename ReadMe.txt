approach1:

Validation Function:

Implement a function to check if a given expression is valid. In this context, an expression is valid if the count of open and close parentheses is balanced, and every close parenthesis has a corresponding open parenthesis.
DFS Function:

Implement a recursive DFS function that explores different possibilities of removing parentheses.
At each step, you have two options for each parenthesis: include it or exclude it.
Keep track of the count of open and close parentheses, as well as the number of parentheses that have been removed from both sides.
If, at any point, the count of close parentheses becomes greater than open parentheses, the expression becomes invalid, and you can prune that branch of the search.
Base Case:

When you reach the end of the input string, check if the current expression is valid and if the number of parentheses removed from both sides is within the allowed limit.
Explore Possibilities:

Recursively explore both options for each parenthesis: include or exclude.
Result Collection:

Maintain a list to collect valid expressions.
Return Result:

Return the list of valid expressions as the final result.
The time complexity of this approach is exponential, O(2^n)

Approach2: 

In-Order Traversal:

Perform an in-order traversal of the BST. In an in-order traversal, visiting nodes in ascending order is guaranteed for a BST.
During the traversal, visit the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.
Track Previous Node:

Keep track of the value of the previous node visited during the traversal. Initialize it to None initially.
Calculate Absolute Difference:

For each node visited, calculate the absolute difference between its value and the value of the previous node.
Update Minimum Difference:

Update the minimum absolute difference whenever a smaller difference is encountered.
Return Result:

The final result is the minimum absolute difference found during the traversal.
By following these steps, you ensure that you consider all possible pairs of nodes in ascending order, and the minimum absolute difference is updated whenever a smaller difference is found.

The time complexity of this approach is O(N).

Approach3:

Initialization:

Initialize a memoization table (memo) to store the shortest path lengths for each state (combination of current node and visited nodes). The table is initialized with infinity for all states except the starting nodes, which have a path length of 0.
Breadth-First Search (BFS):

Start a BFS from all the initial nodes (nodes with only one edge pointing to them).
Use a queue to explore different states (current node, visited nodes, and path length).
Update the memoization table and enqueue new states if a shorter path is found.
Termination:

Continue the BFS until all nodes are visited (mask == target_mask).
Result:

The result is the minimum path length that visits all nodes, and it corresponds to the shortest path among all starting nodes.
The use of bitmasking allows us to keep track of which nodes have been visited in a compact way. The dynamic programming approach ensures that we explore each state only once and store the shortest path length for each state.

The time complexity is O(2^n * n^2)

Approach4:
Define a Recursive Helper Function:

Define a recursive helper function, let's call it max_path_sum_helper, that takes a node as its parameter and returns the maximum path sum that includes the current node.
Base Case:

In the max_path_sum_helper function, handle the base case where the node is None. In this case, the maximum path sum is 0.
Recursive Calculation:

Calculate the maximum path sum in the left and right subtrees by making recursive calls to max_path_sum_helper on the left and right children of the current node.
Ensure that negative values are treated as 0, as including a negative value in the path would only decrease the sum.
Update Global Maximum:

Update the global maximum (max_sum) with the maximum of:
The value of the current node.
The sum of the maximum path sum in the left subtree and the value of the current node.
The sum of the maximum path sum in the right subtree and the value of the current node.
The sum of the maximum path sum in the left subtree, the value of the current node, and the maximum path sum in the right subtree.
Return Maximum Path Sum:

Return the maximum path sum that includes the current node (either the left subtree, right subtree, or both).
Global Maximum as Result:

The final result is stored in the global variable max_sum.
By performing this recursive traversal and updating the global maximum at each step, you can find the maximum path sum of any non-empty path in the binary tree.

The time complexity is O(N)

Approaach5: 
Define DFS Function:

Define a DFS function, let's call it dfs, that takes the current number as a parameter.
In the DFS function, explore the subtree rooted at the current number by going as deep as possible by multiplying the current number by 10. Also, explore the next sibling in the same level by incrementing the current number by 1.
Base Case:

In the DFS function, include a base case to stop the recursion when the current number exceeds n.
Recursive Exploration:

In the DFS function, recursively call itself for both exploring the subtree (going deeper) and exploring the next sibling.
Append to Result:

In each recursive call, append the current number to the result list.
Start DFS:

Start the DFS from the root of the lexicographical order tree, which is 1.
Result:

The result list will contain all numbers from 1 to n in lexicographical order.
By performing this depth-first search traversal, the algorithm ensures that the numbers are explored and appended in lexicographical order.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because each number from 1 to n is visited once.
